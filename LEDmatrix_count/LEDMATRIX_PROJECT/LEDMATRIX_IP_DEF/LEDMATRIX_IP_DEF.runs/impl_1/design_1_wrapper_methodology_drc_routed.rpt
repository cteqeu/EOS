2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.935 ns between design_1_i/MATRIX_IPBLOK_DEF_0/U0/MATRIX_IPBLOK_DEF_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg0_reg[7]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/MATRIX_IPBLOK_DEF_0/U0/MATRIX_IPBLOK_DEF_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/core1/o_data_reg/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
